# Features Map

This project uses GET API request for features with points and shows them on google maps as polygons
and markers. Explanation of the colours:

- if the color of the marker is green - the point accuracy is good.
- if the color of the marker is yellow - the point accuracy is average.
- if the color of the marker is re - the point accuracy is poor.

**Note:** You can zoom in and zoom out in the map to see the features clearer.
